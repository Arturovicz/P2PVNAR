# Vnarchy
Series of my attempts for creating a blockchain from scratch.

This repository is all about Vnarchy blockchain, the evolution of my knowledge in the domain by creating several projects.
First one is the most basic way of apprehending the blockchain environment. 
Second one is pretty much the same thing but improved. Unfortunetly, it wasn't finished due to my lack of understandings in Angular.js
The third one is a more complete blockchain using merkle tree, peer to peer mechanism and other improvements. It has several external dependancies like gopkg.in/vrecan/death.v2, or github.com/dgraph-io/badger, a rapid key-value database. 

There were, however, other prototypes for blockhcains implemented by other databases like mySQL, but their usage may occur a huge waste of processing time.

Projects are partially implemented by the knowledge of other blockchain developpers.
